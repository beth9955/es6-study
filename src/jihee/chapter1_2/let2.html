TL;DR: Both are still global, but vars are stored in the window object, while lets are stored in a declarative environment that you can't see (just like you can't access a variable in a function scope from outside of the function). When declared globally, both statements are pretty much identical in use.

<script>
let sports="축구"; //window object에 선언되지 않음- declarative environment record. //this로는 접근 불가(초기화되지 않음 상태임)
//var sports="기타"; //window object에 선언됨- object environment record //this로 접근가능(변수, 함수, 파라미터)
if(sports){
    let sports ="농구";
    console.log("블록", this.sports); //undefined
    console.log("블록", sports); // 농구
}
    
    console.log("글로벌", sports); //축구

</script>
